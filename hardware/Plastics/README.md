# 3D Printing Guide

There are two ways to print this. You can open the "STL" folder and print each part individually. The problem is that you will not know the correct orientation to place the parts.

The second, and **recommended** way, is to open the "platter" folder and launch the .3MF file using PrusaSlicer. All of the parts have been oriented correctly. 

## Print Settings:
* Use PETG **only**
* 0.25 mm layer height
* In PrusaSlicer go to "Print Settings" -> "Seam position" -> set to "Rear"
